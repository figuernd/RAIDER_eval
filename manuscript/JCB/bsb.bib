* Semi-arbitrary differentiation of families: look at length of non-conserved regions in relation to the whole

Assess on human

Writeupof error model sent to collaborators:

I've worked through the details of Hazelhurt's simulation, and what probabilities they use for errors.   They have put some time into this, so I suggested we use their model and not try to work this out on our own (with the exceptions noted below).  

They actually detail two different models; here I'm only going to give the parameters for the worst-case.  <i>Jenna: I{\textquoteright}m sticking numbers in below, but for your work you are going to want to parametrize it better.  We will go over this later.
</i>
To introduce an error they go through the following steps:

Single base errors: They take this in two steps.  First, they determine if a base has an error, then they determine what sort of error. 

To determine if it is subjected to an error:
First, they allow it to change at a probability of 0.01. 
If it did not change in (1), then they give a second change to change based on its distance from the 3{\textquoteright} end.  This probability here is 0.02x/l, where x is the index number of the base and l is the length of the est.  (So the first base has a probability of 0 of changing for this reason, and the last base has a probability of 0.02.) 
At the end of the est things get even worse.  So if there was no change in step (1) or (2), they let it change with a probability of exp(-0.5sqrt(l-x)).  (So the first base has a probability of exp(-0.5sqrt(l)) -- very small, while the second-to-last base has a probability 0.606 and the last base has a probability of 1. 
There is also extra problems at the beginning.  So an error can happen with probability 0.5(1 {\textendash} tanh(x {\textendash} 50)).  Unlike the pervious steps they have no good way of explaining this, but claim it works well.

If a base is subjected to an error: it could be a substitution, deletion or insertion, each with probability 1/3.  (I presume that {\textquotedblleft}insertion{\textquotedblright} means that a new base is inserted right before it.)  For insertion and substitution its not clear to me how the new base is picked; in absence of discussion, I assume that we pick from the other letters with a uniform probability.


Stuttering: This is when a subsequence gets copied.  This is apparently more likely to happen at a T or a G.

They only allow this when there is a sequence of multiple Ts or multiple Gs; they claim that the probability otherwise is negligible.  If we are at position x, let r_G(x) be the number of contiguous Gs that occur up to and including x.  (So for the sequence AGGGA, r_G(0)=0, r_G(1) = 1, r_G(2) = 2, r_G(3) = 3, and r_G(4) = 0.)  Let r_T(x) be the same for Ts.  Then the probability of a stutter (in terms of the parameter \eta) is:

        (0.5(1-cos(r_G(x)/ \eta)))^2 + (0.5(1-cos(r_T(x)/ \eta)))^2

There is a problem here, because they list the value of the parameter \eta as 0, which obviously makes no sense.  In the other experiment (the non-worst case) they list it as 20.


If stuttering does occur at index x, then the length of the insert sequence is chosen from a uniform distribution over the range (0...2*r_G(x)) or (0...2*r_T(x)).



Ligation: This is when two ESTs (possibly from different genes) get bonded together.  They put the probability of this a 0.  Its not clear to me if they do this because it doesn{\textquoteright}t really happen, or just because they don{\textquoteright}t know how to deal with it.  

Clearly, this error would be serious, as it could cause us to incorrectly join cluster together.  In the short run, I think we should follow there example and ignore it.  In the long run, I{\textquoteright}m hoping we can come up with a detection method.  


Relevance to Chun{\textquoteright}s work: Part of Chun{\textquoteright}s work is on cleaning up the endpoints of the EST, so data we get from him will have less errors at the end.  This was have a directly effect on the probabilities being emulated in step (4) of determining if there is a single base error {\textemdash} reducing that probability of error.  I suspect it will help in step (3) as well.

Other important points:
* Test selectivity with homologos genomes
  - Cap3 handles up to 96%
* Create TIGR Gene Indicies
* Error rate model
* Claim: end points are less spread out, hence EST errors are clustered (2000 paper -- outdate claim?)
* Taking advantage of quality scores

General conclusion: Cap3 is best tool.

* Types of test and test data

Claims the first is a considerable better technique.  Problems related to the second:
1) Many deletions; few representations of any one portion
2) Inability to filter out TEs carried by a segmental duplication

Interesting points:
* Proposes that TEs are lost due to deletions, not sequence decay
* Deleting TEs could be a mechanism for controlling for genome size
* Certain TEs are more likely to be in segmental duplications -- causal effect? }

* EST
* PSSM
* oligo (dT) ???
* vector
* z-score

Summary:
* Looking for cis-regulatoyr signals in Chlamydomonas mRNA transcripts.  Take a large number of transcripts and looks for common patterns in the right place that occur more than would be expected by random.

Finding poly(A) signals (methods):
1. Generates a matrix file containing the occurrence of each designated length of pattern.
2. Rank patterns on frequency
3. Use RSAT to find signals occuring a significant number of times.

Construction of signal logos: 
1. Group hihly ranked patterns on basis of mutal distance.
2. Cluster based on dissimilarity distance.
3. Align by ClustalW

Notes:
* Need poly(A) signals on the mRNA to direct polyandenylation process
* poly(A) signal groups 
   - cleavge site and celeve elements (CE)
   - a strong signal {\textasciitilde}20-30 nt upstrea: nea-upstream element (NUE)
   - far upstream element (FUE) 40-150 nt
   - downstream element 20-30 nt
* Varies by species
   - Mamals:
       a. All four required
       b. FUE well conserved; NUE not so
       c. Downstream unique(?) to mammals
   - yeast/plant:
       a. No downstream
       b. Less conserved
* Algae: Unknoown
   - Possible poyl. signal for Chalmy: UGUAA
* APA: Alternative polyadenylation
   - Used to change product
   - Use to regulate product by making it non-functional

ResultS:
* Define a ply(A) site as the genome bases right before a tail

Check on: 
* GMAP -- map ESTs to genome
* SignalSleuth -- find Poly(A) signal patterns
* RSAT -- look for unsually frequent patterns}

-- Young exons are more involved with alternative splicing
-- Young exons are more likely to overlap repeats (ALUs)
-- Cassette exons tend to be younger
-- Young exons have lower inclusion rates
-- Young exons ar more likely to fall in 3' UTRs
-- Young exons have a faster rate of translation

* Can we document the mutations leading to the creation of an exon }
