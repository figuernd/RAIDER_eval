3) Extend seeds

Questions:
* Can we convert l-mers to spaces l-mers (PH style)?}

annote = {Looks at TE identification in D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, exploring two methods:
1) Blast-based sequence searching
2) Profile based search using TE proteins (not genetic sequences)

DeNovo search tool

Claims the first is a considerable better technique.  Problems related to the second:
1) Many deletions; few representations of any one portion
2) Inability to filter out TEs carried by a segmental duplication

Interesting points:
* Proposes that TEs are lost due to deletions, not sequence decay
* Deleting TEs could be a mechanism for controlling for genome size
* Certain TEs are more likely to be in segmental duplications -- causal effect? }
