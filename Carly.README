Description of all of the scripts I have written and any other resources that may
be helpful in the testing of phRAIDER.

in the RAIDER_eval/aseed_files directory:
  subdir aseeds:    Contains all of the various spaced seed files I have used
                    while testing phRAIDER. The most recent files are in this
                    main directory, not in the subdirectories. File names are
                    pretty descriptive. W used in any file name denotes weight
                    L used in any file name denotes length. patternhunter.txt
                    contains the seed used by the original PatternHunter paper,
                    patternhunter_modified* files are modifications I made based
                    on hunches from previous results. Same for raider_paper.txt
                    and raider_paper_modified* files.
  subdir programs:  Contains python and bash scripts I created when originally
                    testing phRAIDER. Back when I thought the best seeds would
                    be palindromic.
      -> create_all.py:       generates all spaced seeds possible of specified
                              length and weight. unrealistically long seed file
                              when |length - weight| gets large.
                              Optional arguments:   '-l'/'--length'
                                                    '-w', '--weight'
                              Positional arguments: seed_file
      -> create_all_pals.py:  see create_all.py. only generates palindromic seeds
      -> create_all_palls.sh: bash script wrapper to create palindromic seed files
                              of all combinations of weight and length between
                              specified min and max weight (minw, maxw) and
                              specified min and max length (minl, maxl).
                              Arguments: minw maxw minl maxl
      -> create_pals.sh:      given a string (rep), creates all seeds that are the result
                              of continuously concatenating string with itself.
                              Puts seeds of length greater than (min) but less
                              than (max) into file (fname)
                              Arguments: rep min max fname
in RAIDER_eval directory:

  MAINTAIN
    cleanup.sh: shell script that will remove all extra files from an output
                directory after running RAIDER_eval. Removes all tool-specific
                output directories. Keeps debug.txt, seed_file.txt, and stats files

  ANALYZE
    R files:
      -> sorted_analyze.R   :   helper R script for formatting stats data from RAIDER_eval.
                                provides functions for sorting data, as well as adding extra/
                                removing excess information to/from the data. also includes
                                function for outputting data to file/stdout.
      -> doSortedAnalysis.R :   script for sorting stats data from  RAIDER_eval output.
                                Allows options for adding/removing/formatting data.
                                  Arguments:
                                    -v/--verbose  specifies whether output will print to stdout. default = True
                                    -f/--fname    specifies stats file path
                                    -o/--output   specifies file to print output to
                                    --formula     specifies sorting formula for output. default = ~-tpr (Descending by sensitivity)
                                    -a/--auto_out specifies to print output to default file in same directory
                                    -t/--add_type specifies to add info about whether analyzing seq/sim data
                                    -c/--add_chrom specifies to add info about chromosome being analyzed
                                    -s/--suppress_seeds specifies not to add seed specific information
                                    -i            specifies to not include time/space complexity information
                                    -m            specifies to include directory information
      -> doCombinedAnalysis.R : script for combining stats data from multiple RAIDER_eval
                                output directories. Recursively searches for all files in
                                specified directory that are named "stats.txt". Combines all
                                data together, and allows options foradding/removing/formatting data.
                                    Arguments: same as doSortedAnalysis.R, except -f/--fname
                                        is replaced by -d/--dirname

    AUTOMATE
      rev_sf.sh :   shell script that automates the process of naming RAIDER_eval output directory,
                    running the RAIDER_eval program, cleaning up the output directory, and
                    creating a formatted statistics output file.
                      Arguments:
                        $dir - base directory for output dir, to be modified
                        $sfile OR $seed - depending on which, adjusts naming of output dir to indicate
                        $freq
                        $data
                        $type (default is seq_files)
